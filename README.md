# How to scrap basic datas on luxury bags using Python ?

In this project, I will scrap basic datas (concerning price, matter, size etc) from the website presenting the bags of a well-known luxury brand. The aim of this project is basically to create a dataset containing all the datas I will need, to do further analysis on the second-hand luxury sector. The long-term purpose is basically to learn how to do web scraping with Python.

*You cand find the website (containing all the bags) from which I will work [here](https://www.collectorsquare.com/sacs/louis-vuitton/?filters[genders][0]=lad&filters[bag_category][0]=bag-xxxxx&filters[bag_category][1]=shoulderx&filters[bag_category][2]=shoppgbag&filters[bag_category][3]=backpabag&filters[bag_category][4]=luggage-x&filters[bag_category][5]=businessx&filters[bag_category][6]=pockthand&filters[bag_category][7]=other-bag).*
